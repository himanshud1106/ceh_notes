# Enumeration:
Enumeration is a process of extracting usernames, machine names, network resources, shares and services from a network. An attacker creates active connection with the system and sends directed queries to gain more information about the target. The attacker uses the information to identify vulnerabilities in the system security, which helps them exploit the target system. It works in intranet environment. It may be illegal depending on the organisation's policies and the laws that are in effect.

# Enumeration allows the attacker to collect the following information:

* Network resources
* Network shares
* Routing table
* Audit and service settings
* SNMP and fully qualified domain name(FQDN) details
* Machine names
* Users and groups
* Applications and banner

Techniques for Enumeration:

* Extracting usernames using email IDs
* Extracting information using default passwords
* Brute force Active Directory
* Extracting information using DNS Zone Transfer
* Extracting user group from windows
* Extracting username using SNMP

# NetBIOS Enumeration:

NetBIOS is considered first for enumeration because it extracts a large amount of sensitive information about the target network, such as users and network shares. It was originally developed as an API for client software to access local area network(LAN) resources. The NetBIOS name is a unique 16-character ASCII string assigned to windows systems to identify network devices over TCP/IP; 15 characters are used for the device name, and the 16th is reserved for the service or record type. It uses UDP port 137(name services), UDP port 138(datagram services), and TCP port 139 (session services).

# Attackers use NetBIOS Enumeration to obtain the following:

* The list of computers that belong to a domain.
* The list of shares on the individual hosts in a network.
* Policies and passwords
* An attacker who finds a windows system with port 139 open can check to see which resources can be accessed or viewed on a remote system.
* It may allows an attacker to read or write to a remote computer system, depending on the availability of shares, or launch a DoS attack.

# SNMP(Simple Network Management Protocol)Enumeration:

* SNMP enumeration is the process of enumerating user accounts and devices on a target system using SNMP.
* SNMP consists of a manager and an agent; agents are embedded on every network device, and the manager is installed on a separate computer
